# 42 simple emacs config


## Setup
To use my simple setup, simply move .emacs and .script into you home directory
`mv .emacs $HOME && mv .script $HOME`
That's it, you're ready to work at school and at home ;) 

### header.el
Dont forget to set as environment variable `MAIL` and `USER` to get correct values and not `marvin@student.42.fr`

####At 42
Please, don't forget to save previous .emacs file in case of backup.
